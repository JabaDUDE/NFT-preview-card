## My process
So I started with the background. It was easy and would lay the foundation for the rest of the webpage. After that, I wanted to figure out how to create the box in the middle of the webpage that would allow me to have all my content inside, which wasn't that hard to do after one quick search on how to form a div into a rectange, instead of taking up the entire webpage. My biggest issues were the bottom part, where I had to have a picture and the words "Creation of Jules Wyvern" set up. I found it difficult because Jules Wyvern's name should've been a different color from the rest of the element so, by creating a new class for the name alone, I created an  element that was out of place. The picture also had some problems since the words would not stay perfectly to the right of it. While it looks fine in my browser right now, I do want to emphasize that I do not believe this webpage to be dynamic. If I change the size of the browser, it all falls apart and I believe it will look bad with a mobile version as well. I could not figure that part out. The active hover states were easy enough to google and implement and I had a lot of fun with that. It's important to note that I did not use the style-guide that was provided for this challenge. I tried to eyeball from the designs given. I'm a long way off from where I need to be in understanding and practice but I'm kind of proud I was able to do most of this on my own, even if it isn't perfect.

### Built with

-HTML
-CSS


### What I learned

.main {
    background-color: #151e58;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 30px;
    width: 30%;
    height: auto;
    position: relative;
    top: 50%;
    bottom: 50%;
    right: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    padding: 10px;

    I am proud of this portion of imperfect code that helped me design the box on the webpage with the content inside. Def not perfect and I'm sure there's better ways to achieve what I did, but I'm fairly proud that I did this on without looking anything up.
    
### Continued development

I want to figure out a way to continuously make dynamic and active webpages that change with the browser that's being used. That means I can change the size of the window, and whatever I create will be able to fit inside of it without the content being distorted.



## Acknowledgments

Big thank you for frontendmentor.io for the challenge and thank you to the individual who also did this challenge who helped me figure out how to troubleshoot my issue with Jules Wyvern's name. I didn't use her method but it did give me an idea on how to fix my issue.
